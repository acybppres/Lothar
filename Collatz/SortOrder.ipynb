    "    - 010101... is always 1: I think its tree indexes from the top of each generation are $[0, 1 (01), 6 (0110), ]$ starting with generation 0?? then g+2, g+4, ...\n",
    "    - 1010101... is always 2: ??? Indexes from generation top will be same as 1 but starting from generation 2 ???\n",

    "    - etc\n",
    "- [1*]000 for generations >=3 is always the minimum value (three zeros in a row turns a large positive number into a large negative number)\n",
